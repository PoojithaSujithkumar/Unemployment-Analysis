# Unemployment-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed unemployment trends and applied Linear Regression to predict future unemployment rates. Key steps included dataset cleaning, statistical exploration, model training, and visualization using bar charts and line graphs. This strengthened my skills in data analysis, regression, and visualization.

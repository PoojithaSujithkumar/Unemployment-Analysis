# 📊 Unemployment Analysis – Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, where I analyzed unemployment trends and applied **Linear Regression** to predict future unemployment rates. The goal was to understand key patterns and identify factors influencing joblessness.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Unemployment rates** over different time periods  
- **Economic indicators** impacting employment levels  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## 🔍 Workflow  
✅ **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Processed missing values and ensured data consistency.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identified trends using descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
✅ **Model Training:** Applied **Linear Regression** to predict unemployment rates.  
✅ **Evaluation:** Assessed model accuracy using **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score**.  
✅ **Visualization:** Plotted **line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps** to interpret insights.  

## 📈 Results  
- Successfully identified **patterns in unemployment trends**.  
- Built a predictive model to forecast future unemployment rates.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- Enhanced **data analysis, regression modeling, and visualization** skills.  
- Improved understanding of **economic indicators and their impact on employment**.  

## 🌟 Acknowledgment  
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, providing practical experience in **data-driven decision-making**.
